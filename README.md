# GraphQL User Registration Project

Welcome to the GraphQL User Registration Project! This repository demonstrates a fully functional GraphQL server implemented with Node.js, Apollo Server, and PostgreSQL. It provides an educational platform to understand GraphQL principles, server-side development, and database interactions, specifically focusing on user registration and management.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to building a GraphQL API for user registration. It encompasses foundational concepts of GraphQL and provides hands-on experience with API design, server-side logic, and database interactions. The project is structured to enhance learning and application of GraphQL concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** (version 12 or later)
- **Postman** or **GraphQL Playground** for testing the API

Additionally, familiarity with the following concepts will be beneficial:

- JavaScript ES6+ syntax
- SQL and relational database design
- Basic GraphQL concepts (queries, mutations, and schema design)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhautikVekariya21/graphql.git
   cd graphql
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a PostgreSQL database:**
   Ensure you have a PostgreSQL server running and create a new database for this project.

4. **Configure the database connection:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
   ```

5. **Run database migrations:**
   Initialize the database schema using Sequelize:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

## Usage

To start the GraphQL server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:4000` to test your GraphQL queries and mutations.

## GraphQL API Documentation

### User Registration Mutation

To register a new user, use the following mutation in the GraphQL Playground:

```graphql
mutation {
  registerUser(username: "exampleUser", password: "examplePassword") {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `username` (String!): The desired username for the new user.
- `password` (String!): The password for the new user (ensure to implement proper hashing).

**Response:**
- `id`: The unique identifier of the newly created user.
- `username`: The username of the newly created user.

### User Queries

You can retrieve a list of registered users with this query:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

**Response:**
- `users`: An array of user objects, each containing `id` and `username`.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

```
/graphql
  ├── models              # Database models (e.g., User model)
  ├── migrations          # Database migration files
  ├── src
  │   ├── schema.js       # GraphQL schema definitions
  │   ├── resolvers.js     # Resolvers for handling queries and mutations
  │   └── server.js       # Apollo Server setup and configurations
  ├── .env                # Environment variables for database connection
  ├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
  └── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies
```

## Detailed Project Descriptions

### Models

The `models` folder contains Sequelize models that define the structure of the database tables. For instance, the `User` model defines the user data schema, including fields such as `id`, `username`, and `password`.

### Migrations

This directory includes migration files that help manage the database schema over time, allowing you to create and modify tables easily using Sequelize.

### Server Setup

The `server.js` file initializes the Apollo Server and connects to the PostgreSQL database. It includes middleware for authentication and error handling, ensuring a robust server configuration.

### GraphQL Schema and Resolvers

- **schema.js**: This file defines the GraphQL types, queries, and mutations.
- **resolvers.js**: Contains the logic to handle each GraphQL operation, interfacing with the database models to perform actions like creating and retrieving users.

## Testing

To ensure the functionality of your API, you can use tools like Postman or GraphQL Playground to perform manual tests on your GraphQL endpoints. Consider implementing automated tests using libraries like Jest or Mocha for a more robust testing strategy.
